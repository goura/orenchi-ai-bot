# Discord AI Chatbot - Implementation Complete

## Overview

The Discord AI Chatbot is now fully implemented with all features outlined in the design document. The bot provides private, one-on-one conversations with customizable personalities, powered by OpenRouter's AI models.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Private Channel Management
- Automatic creation of private channels when users start conversations
- Proper permission management (users can only see their own private channels)
- Periodic cleanup of inactive channels (after 24 hours of inactivity)
- Welcome messages in new private channels

### 2. Personality Customization
- Users can set custom personalities with the `/personality` command
- Personalities are stored in an SQLite database
- Personalities are used as system instructions for the AI model

### 3. Conversation Handling
- Support for both slash commands and mentions to start conversations
- Context-aware responses using actual Discord message history
- Fallback to in-memory history if Discord history fetching fails

### 4. Slash Commands
- `/personality [text]` - Set your custom personality for the bot
- `/ai-start-chat` - Start a new private conversation
- `/ai-end-chat` - End current conversation and delete channel

### 5. Testing
- Comprehensive test coverage using Bun's built-in test runner

## Technology Stack
